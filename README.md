# Automated-Writing-Evaluation-AWE-System
**Effectiveness of Chain of Thought Prompting in automated writing evaluation of argumentative essays**

Welcome to the Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) Tool repository. This repository contains two main components that streamline the process of analyzing and providing feedback on written texts. The first component is the PROMPTS folder, which houses 16 distinct prompt files corresponding to separate error categories. Each prompt is specifically designed to identify and tag issues ranging from grammar and punctuation to advanced lexical errors. By using these meticulously crafted prompts, the system ensures consistent, in-depth error analysis.

The second core asset is the AWE_CoT_Tool.exe standalone executable. This Windows-compatible tool requires no additional installations or Python dependencies. Simply download the file, launch it, and select the text (.txt) file you wish to evaluate. You can choose which error categories to analyze and specify how you want the results presented: individually, as a combined, or both. Once processing completes, the tool saves the findings in a user-defined location, providing clear, structured feedback. By combining a comprehensive error framework with advanced automation, our AWE Tool offers a robust, easy-to-use solution for improving written communication. It also promotes consistency, efficiency, and clarity in everyday writing evaluation tasks.
